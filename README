Requirements : 

curl, docker and docker-compose installed.

Instructions :  

In a first tab : execute that command from the base folder to run the 3 containers and watch logs : 
docker-compose up --build && docker logs -f

In a second tab : execute that command multiple times to check the load balanced behavior (look at logs in the first tab)
curl -L http://localhost:7010/what-to-do
